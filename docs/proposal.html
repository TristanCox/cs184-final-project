					<div class="info-content">
						<div class="info-required">Summary</div>
						<div class="info-intro">In this project we are going to implement a simulation of a magnet interacting with particles. Operating in two dimensions, we plan to show how the particles can form shapes and how different magnetic fields affect them.

							<div class="body-header">Problem Description</div>


							<p></p>
							<p> Magnets have been widely studied in many different
								areas, with the visualization of magnetic fields
								being a large basis of understanding. We would
								like to explore magnets in terms of particles,
								or iron filings, and demonstrate shapes that
								different magnetic fields can make through them.
								We plan to get creative by introducing stencils
								and allowing the user to upload their own. A
								possible challenge could be when we introduce
								more than one magnetic, and we need to look at
								both how the magnets interact with the particles
								and how they interact with each other. </p>

							<div class="body-header">Goals and Deliverables</div>
							<p></p>
							<ul>

							<li> Our primary goal is to display a 2D simulation of metal shards manipulated by magnetism.
							</li>
							<li> We plan to allow characteristics of the magnet to be manipulated and altered.</li>
							<li> In addition, we will be able to vary the number of magnets and shards in the simulator.
							</li>
							<li> Finally, we hope to deliver the ability to sketch out different drawings with the metal shards and provide the user with the ability to input their own sketches.
							</li>
							<li> In order to determine the accuracy of our magnetic systems, we may use a number of methods, including visual comparison. If we find some formula that we have to approximate for speed, we can compare it to a slower, 
								much more accurate rendering and calculate the difference.
							</li>
							<li> If we have time, we would like to potentially add a third dimension, texture our particles, and very ambitiously turn the particles magnetic.
							</li>
