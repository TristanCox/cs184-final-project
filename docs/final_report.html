			<p></p>
			<p>
			    We began this project without any starter code and no prior knowledge of javascript.
			    After doing some research and talking to our teacher's assistant we decided to use Two.js
			    which would allow us to render our two dimensional simulation in the web browser. 
			</p>
			<p>
			    We started our project by implementing a physically accurate magnetic vector field. We
			    did some research into magnetic physics formulae and determined that we would need to 
			    calculate the magnetic flux and dipole moment.
			    \[flux\ density:\ B(r) =  {\mu \over 4\pi} \left[{3n\ (n \cdot m) - m \over
			    \left\lvert r - r_o^3 \right\rvert}\right].\] \[ \]
			    \[force\ on\ particles:\ F =\ \nabla\ (m \cdot b).\]
			</p>
			<p>
			    Above are the formulae used to calculate the magnetic field vectors that we subsequently
			    rendered.
			</p>

			<p>
			     We looped through the space surrounding the magnet and used the distance from the magnet
			     as well as properties of the magnet to determine the strength of the magnetic field at
			     different locations. At the time we simply rendered these as lines and there was no other
			     real consequence of these calculations. 
			</p>
			<p> 
			    Since we were rendering our simulations live instead of prerendering them, we ran into
			    optimazation issues immediatly. Without even adding particles, due to the large resolution of our
			    magnetic fields it was taking a long time for the user to interact with the magnets. We
			    realised that we could adjust how much of the field we displayed according the magnetic
			    strength. The reasoning being that if the magnetic strength is low enough to not have a significant
			    effect on a vector currently being calculated, it is a waste of resources to include in our
			    rendering. Setting these limitations helped significantly with the speed of the simulation.

			</p>
			<p>
			    Another approach we attempted to optimize our code was to switch to polar coordinates
			    instead cartesian coordinates following a recomendation after our milestone. Since we used
			    magnetic strength to determine what lines were rendered, this created a limitation around
			    each magnet that was dependent on a specific radius calculated from the magnetic strength. 
			    We thought that by looping from the center of each magnet to that radius we could create a
			    more efficient system. Unfortunetly this did not give us the optimization we were after or
			    pleasing visual results.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			    We also played with the step size and saw that not only did a bigger step size improve our
			    optimization, it also maintained the classical magnetic field shape that we were after. 
			</p>
			<p>
			    Since the strength of the field determined the length of the line displayed, we limited them
			    to not overtake each other to the extent that it would compromise the shape of the magnetic
			    field. This greatly improved our visual results.
			</p>

			<p>
			    After we successfully optimized our code we were able to display multiple magnets and render
			    their magnetic fields interacting in a timely manner. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
			    Our next step was introducing particles into the magnetic field. We were originally inspired
			    to render iron shards inside the magnetic field. However, what we did not realize at the
			    time was that iron shards in magnetic fields produce such interesting images because they
			    are ferromagnets. These special types of magnets in contrast to permanent magnets (which have
			    their own magnetic moments) are magnetized by the external magnetic field. The interesting patterns are 
			    formed by the magnetic forces between iron filings. In order to render ferromagnets we would have
			    needed to calculate the magnetic force betweeen each particle as they each "turn in to" a magnet when
			    they are placed in the magnetic field. This explains why the iron shards remain in the field and 
			    do not fly away dramatically. 
			</p>

			<p>
			    Since having a live magnetic playground was important to us, we decided to instead render
			    regular metal particles without the special ferromagnetic properties. This is where we diverged from
			    the primary research paper we were referencing and had to determine our own standard for a successful
			    representation.
			</p>
			<p>
			    For each particle we determined whether it was in the magnetic field and if it was, we
			    applied bi-linear interpolation to determine the approximate aggregate force.
			</p>
			<p>
			    \[lerp(x, v_0, v_1) =\ v_0 + x(v_1-v_0).\]
			</p>
			<p>
			    We then calculated the acceleration and used Verlet Integration to update the position of the
			    particle.  

			    \[ x_{t+dt} = x_t + v_t * dt + a_t *dt^2.\]
			</p>
			<p>
			    In order to make sure the particles correctly interacted with the magnet, we had to deal
			    with collisions. Specifically, our simulation needed to show that when a particle collides
			    with a magnet, it does not continue to move in the direction of the magnetic field lines but
			    rather comes to a halt. We used priciples discussed in project four in order to detect
			    colisions and set the velocity to zero so it would appear to stick to the magnet. When the
			    magnet is dragged to a new position, everything is reset and the particles will be able to
			    move once again.
			</p>

			<p>
			    In order to make our system interactive we used dat.gui.js to implement a graphical user
			    interface (GUI). We made it possible for the user to adjust the strength of each magnet, drag each
			    magnet, and introduce new magnets into the simulation. By implementing the GUI we were able
			    to finally create the magnetic playground we set out to accomplish.

			<div class="body-header"> Contribution Breakdown </div>

			<p>
			    Since this project had to be done completely virtually due to COVID-19, much of the
			    project implementation was done via pair programming. One person would share their
			    screen while the others would watch, advise, and debug.
			</p>	
			<ul>
			    <li>
				Tristan took the lead on implementing the magnetic field lines and adding particle
				movement.
			    </li>	
			    <li>
				Amber focused on improving optimization and implementing the GUI.
			    </li>	
			    <li>
				Isabel was responsible for collision detection and creating the website where we host our
				simulation and all our documentation.
			    </li>
			</ul>

			<p>
			    Even though we each had parts that we worked on more than others, we were all very involved
			    in each stage of the project whether that be in the form of researching, debugging, or providing direction.
