			<div class="info-required">Summary</div>
			<div class="info-intro">In this project we are going to implement a simulation of a magnet interacting with particles. Operating in two dimensions, we plan to show how the particles can form shapes and how different magnetic fields affect them.

			<p></p>
			<p>We were able to simulate magnetic field vectors. We began
			    implementing our user interface by adding an
			    interactive feature to adjust the magnetic strength. In
			    addition, we added a second magnet and rendered the
			    interactions of their magnetic fields.</p>

			<div class="body-header">Preliminary Results</div>
			<p></p>
			<p>
			    Although we are very satisfied with our current progress, we
			    have run in to some unexpected edge cases such as keeping in
			    mind the length of the lines as they directly correlate to
			    magnetic field strength. We were able to solve this edge
			    case by putting a hard limit on vector field line length.

			    Throughout the last few weeks building our simulation, we
			    have realized that rendering live changes is going to require us to start
			    prioritizing optimization going forward. Some concerns we
			    have are when rendering multiple magnets the run time
			    increases linearly. In addition, if we adjust the magnet
			    properties, the simulation has to rerender everything which
			    takes longer with a high magnetic strength.
